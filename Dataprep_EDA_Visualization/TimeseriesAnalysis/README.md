# Data Preparation, EDA, Visualization, and Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and time series analysis of a selected dataset. The goal is to gain insights into data trends over time and make informed predictions.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Objective: Clean and transform raw data for analysis.
   - Steps:
     - Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
     - Standardize formats and transform variables for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Objective: Use statistical and exploratory techniques to understand patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the dataset.
   - Steps:
     - Check distributions, correlations, and summary statistics.
     - Identify and understand underlying patterns within the data.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Objective: Present insights in a compelling visual format for better comprehension and communication.
   - Tools: Generate various charts and graphs to highlight key findings.
   - Output: Visualizations support data-driven decision-making and help communicate findings to stakeholders.

4. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Objective: Analyze temporal trends, seasonality, and patterns to forecast future values.
   - Key Points:
     - Pattern Identification: Recognize recurring patterns and seasonal variations.
     - Forecasting: Make predictions based on historical patterns.
   - Applications: Commonly used in finance, economics, sales forecasting, and other fields where data trends over time are essential.

## Steps for Dataset Collection from Kaggle

1. **Setting up the Kaggle API**:
   - Download and authenticate the Kaggle API to streamline dataset downloads.
   - Move the Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) to the appropriate directory and set permissions.

2. **Data Download and Loading**:
   - Use the Kaggle API to fetch the dataset and load it for analysis.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, etc.
   - Kaggle API set up with a valid `kaggle.json` key.

2. **Steps**:
   - Follow the code cells in the notebook, starting with setting up the Kaggle API, then proceed to data preparation, EDA, visualization, and time series analysis.

## Results and Findings

The notebook concludes with:
- **Data Insights**: Summary statistics, correlations, and visual patterns.
- **Forecasting**: Predicted future values based on time series analysis.
