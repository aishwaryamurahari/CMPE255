## Abstract
Dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP are essential for visualizing high-dimensional data, but they struggle to handle massive datasets due to computational and memory constraints. This project explores the use of Out-of-Sample (OOS) Extensions, a scalable framework that incrementally maps new data points into an existing low-dimensional projection, enabling DR on datasets with millions or billions of points. We evaluate the performance of OOS-enhanced DR methods, compare them with state-of-the-art techniques like TriMAP and PaCMAP, and highlight trade-offs in preserving local and global structures. A real-world use case with 1 billion streamlines demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of OOS extensions for large-scale visualization, showcasing their ability to process data on consumer-grade hardware while maintaining projection quality. This work provides practical insights and tools for leveraging DR in big data applications.
